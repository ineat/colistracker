This task makes use of the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/convert-asciidoc-to-pdf/[asciidoctor-pdf] plugin to render your documents as a pretty PDF file.

The file will be written to `build/pdf`.

NOTE: The used plugin is still in alpha status, but the results are already quite good.
If you want to use another way to create a PDF, use https://phantomjs.org/[PhantomJS] for instance and script it.

The PDF is generated directly from your AsciiDoc sources without the need of an intermediate format or other tools.
The result looks more like a nicely rendered book than a print-to-pdf HTML page.

It is very likely that you need to "theme" you PDF - change colors, fonts, page header, and footer.
This can be done by creating a `custom-theme.yml` file.
As a starting point, copy the file `src/docs/pdfTheme/custom-theme.yml` from docToolchain to your project and reference it from your main `.adoc`file via setting the `:pdf-stylesdir:`.
For instance, insert

    :pdf-stylesdir: ../pdfTheme
    
at the top of your document to reference the `custom-theme.yml` from the `/pdfTheme` folder.

Documentation on how to modify a theme can be found in the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf/blob/master/docs/theming-guide.adoc[asciidoctor-pdf theming guide].
