Whenever Asciidoctor has to process a file which is not UTF-8 encoded, the underlying Ruby tries to read it and throws an error like this:

    asciidoctor: FAILED: /home/demo/test.adoc: Failed to load AsciiDoc document - invalid byte sequence in UTF-8

Unfortunately, it is hard to find the wrong encoded file if a lot of `includes::` are used - Asciidoctor only shows the name of the main document.

NOTE: This is not a problem of Asciidoctor, but of the underlying ruby interpreter.

This target crawls through all `+++*.ad+++` and `+++*.adoc+++` files and checks their encoding.
If it encounters a file which is not UTF-8 encoded, it will rewrite it with the UTF-8 encoding.
