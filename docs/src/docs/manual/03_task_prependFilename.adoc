When Asciidoctor renders a file, the file context only knows the name of the top-level AsciiDoc file but an include file doesn't know that it is being included.
It will simply get the name of the master file and has no chance to get his own names as attribute.

This task simply crawls through all AsciiDoc files and prepends the name of the current file like this:

    :filename: manual/03_task_prependFilename.adoc

This way, each file can get its own file name.
This enables features like the inclusion of file contributors (see exportContributors-task).

NOTE: The task skips all files named `+++config.*+++`, `+++_config.*+++`, `+++feedback.*+++` and `+++_feedback.*+++`.
