This task invokes the https://github.com/aim42/htmlSanityCheck[htmlSanityCheck] gradle plugin.
It is a standalone (batch- and command-line) html sanity checker - it detects missing images, dead links, and duplicate bookmarks.

In docToolchain, this task is used to ensure that the generated HTML contains no missing links or other problems.

This task is the last default task and creates a report in `build/report/htmlchecks/index.html`
